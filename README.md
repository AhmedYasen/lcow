# WinuxCLI - Linux-Like Commands for Windows Command Prompt

## Introduction

WinuxCLI is a project that brings the power and familiarity of Linux-like commands to the Windows Command Prompt. It aims to provide Windows users with a set of commands commonly found in Linux/Unix environments, enabling them to perform tasks in a more familiar and efficient way.

## Features

- **Linux-Like Commands**: WinuxCLI includes a collection of Linux-like commands that are commonly used in terminal environments. These commands have been adapted to work seamlessly on the Windows Command Prompt.

- **Improved Workflow**: With WinuxCLI, Windows users can now take advantage of powerful commands and scripts they might be familiar with from their Linux/Unix experiences, leading to a more streamlined and efficient workflow.

- **Easy to Install**: WinuxCLI is designed to be easy to set up and use. The installation process is straightforward, and the project is actively maintained to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of Windows.

## Installation

To install WinuxCLI on your Windows system, follow these simple steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [WinuxCLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-username/winuxcli/releases).

2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.

3. Add the WinuxCLI directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This step ensures that you can use WinuxCLI commands from any location in the Command Prompt.

4. That's it! You can now start using Linux-like commands on your Windows Command Prompt.

## Usage

Using WinuxCLI is easy! Once you've installed it and added the directory to your PATH, simply open a Command Prompt and start using the Linux-like commands you're familiar with. For example:

```bash
$ ls       # List files and directories in the current folder
$ cd       # Change directory
$ mkdir    # Create a new directory
$ grep     # Search for text in files
$ cat      # Display the contents of a file
$ and more!
```

Please note that while the commands are designed to mimic Linux behavior, there might be some slight differences due to the underlying Windows architecture.
